        <p>June 29th, 2024</p>
        <p>Angel Rittenburg,</p>
        <p>lf you're going to apologize sincerely, ensure the facts you use are correct.</p>
            <p>Your sarcastic and meaningless apology attempt got the details wrong again. Whether this was a planned act of slander or unaware harassment to bully me personally and professionally, consider this your notice that I am preparing to defend myself in court against these tactics.
            It's time to set the record straight with the following points:</p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You need to publicly apologize and own your misdeeds like an adult. Yes, we appreciate that.<br />To be clear:<br /></li>
                    <li>The meeting moderators escorted us upstairs to begin the scheduled 10 AM program precisely at 10:06:39.841. I am requesting the sign-in sheet for evidence of this attendance record. Also a total of Six other attendees arrived after Zia and me, but also before the meeting began.</li>
                    <li>While waiting for others to join, the moderators offered drinks, coffee, and refreshments, which we all had time to enjoy.</li>
                    <li>In addition to discussing HUD's Annual Plan at this meeting, I also attended and provided input on duplicate meetings for the same discussion on 5/ 17 / 24, 5/23/24,without incident or a time-keeper as well as the 6/7/24 being dissected to death. I was only obligated to attend one of the dates, by the way.</li>
                    <li>You caused our imagined tardiness by leaving without your fellow board members and subsequently stranding us after the meeting You need to be accountable for costing the TA $6o+unnecessarily, don't you think? Or isn't courtesy a trait desired anymore?</li>
                    <li>We were awarded wonderful Certificates of Excellence when sworn-in on 6/27/24 after all ballots were counted publicly. To be followed by our first order of business emergency meeting of the new board, including a 24-hour contemplation period satisfying health and safety wellness issues affecting a 2nd emergency meeting on 6/28/24,where a unanimous decision was made to officially remove you from office.</li>
                    <li>Consequently, your services are no longer required or desired due to prolonged dereliction of duties and interference endangering this office, including major harassment, bullying and threats made to interfere with the peaceful enjoyment of my home.</li>
                    <li>Please return all TA property, including checkbooks no longer under your authority. Respectfully acknowledge the authority of this office and hand over all relevant correspondence as you transition out as a valued member of our 1760 community, refraining from further abusive behavior.</li>
                    <li>It is unlawful for you to post communications to your neighbors except on the designated bulletin board designed for that in the laundry room. Abusive or corrosive postings will not be tolerated and may lead to further actions.</li>
                    <li>Due to the urgency and severity of infractions, including continuing bypass the 30-day notice bylaw. Immediate action is necessary.</li>
                    <li>For inquiries, contact Vice President Mr. John Jolly, Suite 705, and cease slanderous actions against President and HOC Commissioner McNulty, or face liability for damages.</li>
                    <li>Consider this your official notification. NO doxing necessary; we are informing management, CCSD, Housing Commissioners, and HUD officials. No further Doxing is expected or desired.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Also the fact is you were never elected to office. Instead you bit the hand that started you and left your desired traits of gratitude, appreciation & loyalty at home, I guess. It happens. You’re punishing me for something I did to your by accident, which did not reveal anything, you know? I know. I remember you misdirected rage, but nobody else knows why you’ve set your sights so hard against me. People want a reason. An authentic reason. When you discover one, let me in on it too, okay?</p>
            <p>If you’ll recall correctly, or read the facts on the official records, you’ll see it was me. I was the one. I appointed you to your office to fill a mid-term vacancy vacated by a death- only a few short months ago, less than a year anyway, remember that? Then, during this past election cycle, you nominated yourself but you were never voted into the actual Office. We must be factual guardians of the record, or the devil wins. Right ballots had very special places for voters to write in and show their support of each candidate with an X by their individual names.</p>
            <p>There’s still time to let bygones be gone;</p>
            <p>I’m not one to hold a grudge. Maybe when you’re ready we can share an olive brance, and start fresh? It won’t be with yo in office but we can still put that silly foe pah away, anyway?</p>
            <p>Perhaps, think about it? I’m willing to start fresh anytime you say ready.</p>
            <p>By the way, Michelle had 2 votes even though she didn’t attend due to a dealth in the famly. That says something good about her. Her ruling the roost will surely be missed! God love her!</p>
            <p>I am proud to tell you I received a total of 25 out of 25 distinguishing marks. You had none; possibly due to your not showing but now we can never know. President Margaret McNulty.</p>
