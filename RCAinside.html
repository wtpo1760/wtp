        <h1>Resident Council of Adivsors Proposal</h1>
<h3>by Margo McNulty</h3>
<h3>Reviewed by Angel Rittenburg</h3>
<p>In my opinion, any government agency is open to new ideas on how to fulfill the work of the government. My opinion is formed from my experience as a former picture framing business owner, former Tribal Operations Secretary for a Native American tribe, former Contract Administrator for the Oakland Housing Authority, former Secretary for <a href="http://www.genesisca.org" target="_new">Genesis in Oakland</a>, former Secretary, Minister, and Committee Member at <a href="https://fccolovefirst.org/" target="_new">First Congregational Church of Oakland, CA</a>. <a href="https://www.gamaliel.org" target="_new">Gamaliel</a> I am always open to hear ideas from other people but, I will not blindly endorse a plan from anyone without reviewing and evaluation on my own.</p>
<p>Several times Margo asked me if I would support her plan. I told her before I could, I had questions. Margo never made herself available for those questions.</p>
<p>The provided document <strong>RCA Proposal</strong> is primarily focused on Root Cause Analysis methodologies and their applications. In my opinion, this proposal in its current form does not appear to be a well-planned and plotted implementation plan for replacing a multi-jurisdiction agency tasked with providing independent financial oversight and proper elections, as required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-24/subtitle-B/chapter-IX/part-964?toc=1" target="_new">the Code of Federal Regulations Title 24 Part 964</a>.</p>
<p>To create a suitable implementation plan for this purpose, the document would need to address several key elements, including:
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Objective and Scope:</strong></li>
            <ul>- Define the specific goals of replacing the agency.</ul>
            <ul>- Outline the scope of the changes and the jurisdictions involved.</ul>
        <li><strong>Legal and Regulatory Compliance:</strong></li>
        <ul>- Ensure compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations Title 24 Part 964.</ul>
        <ul>- Identify and address any legal and regulatory requirements for financial oversight and election procedures.</ul>
        <li><strong>Governance Structure:</strong></li>
        <ul>- Develop a new governance structure that ensures independent financial oversight.</ul>
        <ul>- Establish clear roles and responsibilities for overseeing proper elections.</ul>
        <li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement:</strong></li>
        <ul>- Engage with stakeholders, including residents, local authorities, and federal agencies, to gather input and build support.</ul>
        <ul>- Establish communication channels to keep stakeholders informed throughout the implementation process.</ul>
        <li><strong>Transition Plan:</strong></li>
        <ul>- Develop a detailed transition plan that outlines the steps for phasing out the existing agency and establishing the new oversight body.</ul>
        <ul>- Include timelines, milestones, and key deliverables.</ul>
        <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong></li>
        <ul>- Identify the resources required for the transition, including personnel, budget, and technology.</ul>
        <ul>- Develop a budget and allocate resources accordingly.</ul>
        <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong></li>
        <ul>- Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.</ul>
        <ul>- Establish a risk management plan to address any issues that arise during the transition.</ul>
        <li><strong>Monitoring and Evaluation:</strong></li>
            <ul>- Develop a plan for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the new oversight body.</ul>
            <ul>- Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and reporting mechanisms.</ul>
    </ol>
    <p>The focus of the <strong>RCA Proposal</strong> is analyzing the root cause of problems and issues arising from implementing the HUD/RAD program, but it does not provide the steps necessary to fund, staff, and ensure implementation of this plan.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the <strong>RCA Proposal</strong> does not specify a legitimate source for training materials. For a proposal to be considered legitimate in terms of training materials, it should include references to reputable sources, accredited training programs, or recognized experts in the field to support the material presented.</p>
    <p>For a proposal to be considered legitimate in terms of training materials, it should include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Credentials of any of the Trainers</li>
        <li>Examples of relevant training material</li>
        <li>References to reputable sources for any claims regarding organizational efficiency or inefficiency</li>
        <li>Listing of issues that this proposal would address</li>
        <li>Referencing existing and proven accredited HUD/RAD Tenant Association training programs, or any recognized experts in the field</li>
    </ul>
