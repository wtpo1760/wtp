        <p>Hello Dear Tenants,</p>
        <p>I'd like to alert you to a potentially big problem I'm having: CCS/D, (Citywide Council-Seniors/Disabled) is in disarray, to put it mildly.</p>
        <p>Since becoming their President, after 6 months, I thought I would be able to lead it to at least close to what Beverly Saba envisioned for the organization which she led to greatness for years before her death.</p>
        <p>Since then, CCSD has had a succession of ill equipped Presidents, for example: Dennis Katonis (2018-2022) would fight loudly at his Board meetings for a year, combating Mary, his Secretary, getting nothing done, setting the dysfunctional tone, finally taking the fight to Civil Court, then, having it thrown out. Next President, Peter Kats, saw the disorganization and quit... Then I came along.</p>
        <p>If you know me at all, you'll know that I have a deep seated concern for our Rights and our Community. Ever since I was homeless living on the streets for a year, I've garnered a healthy Attitude of Gratitude and I don't take our Roof (Or benefits) for granted.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate regarding our Human Rights and our Tenant Rights now falling under HUD's Public-Private Subsidized Housing laws and Section 8 (voucher programs). I've constantly studied these new laws and the rights that come with them. I pride myself on being YOUR Advocate when you don't get anywhere with problems or concerns of your household. I study rent calculations and recertification procedures, and count myself generally ready to represent our collective voices to The Housing Commissioners/SFHA(San Francisco Housing Authority), and to Helen Hale, now promoted to The Director of Mayor's Office of Housing.</p>
        <p>I've continued to stay motivated to bring to YOU the best environment for us to co-habitate, doing what I can to make our lives better here in Public-Private Housing.</p>
        <p>So, I generally was looking forward to taking on the position as Leader for CCSD for a long time. Now, not so sure.</p>
        <p>Every Board meeting I go to at CCSD ends in a practice fist fight. Members insult each other, don't wait for their turn to talk, shout derogatory remarks and curse at each other. They act worse than children. How can they, or I, hope to get anything done? Their affiliates are pulling out one after another.</p>
        <p>However, armed with my tales of dysfunction, I went to Helen Hale, whose job it is to sort these things through. She actually said to me, "Slow down, you're getting too much done!" She actually asked me" to not be so functional!" but instead "match the dysfunction of the Board", who are famous for not taking action between stipend checks, by the way.</p>
        <p>I asked Helen, "What benefit could you possibly have to see CCSD dysfunctional?" and got no response. Now rumor tells me she bought in with the builders, so has given up on the effectiveness of any Resident Council. Now, it starts to make sense.</p>
        <p>Helens vision is that if you have a problem or concern, it's to go to Management. If they refuse to act go to their Supervisor. Tenants have met with retaliation when doing this in many instances and never receive confidentiality and their situation doesn't change.</p>
        <p>Then I asked about security: I asked, "Does the owner have any responsibility to provide security? She stated, point blank: "NO." Saying that it's not in our lease. Well, a little investigation further alerted me that these owners HAVE to assure their buildings are secure BEFORE receiving any money from HUD. It's #6 on the application!! She looked at my face, and lied.</p>
        <p>My vision, and the way it was explained to me was, if a tenant has a problem they can't solve on their own, bring it to Resident Council. If the Resident Council (Your Tenant Association) can't do anything, they bring it to CCSD to solve. If CCSD can't do anything to help, they bring the problem to the Commissioners (Who incidentally put it on Helen's shoulders),</p>
        <p>Cue my new proposal: I'm promoting CCSD have an Oversight Board in between them and the Commissioners, called Resident Council Advisory or RCA; needed to make sure CCSD is acting appropriately. That's how Democracy works; Having Checks and balances of Offices.</p>
        <p>Our collective voice is at risk right now, but I believe we are stronger together! I'm losing hope that CCSD can be fixed on my own. They are furious with me for calling them out on the way they conduct themselves and may soon vote me out of being the President of CCSD. That's okay because when my proposal gets approved, I'll be their Boss.</p>
        <p>They need to be held to a higher standard; they need to be held accountable.</p>
        <p>I have my RCA (Resident Council Advisory) proposal circulating City Hall, The Commissioners, HUD and everywhere I can think of right now.</p>
        <p>RAD will not survive without it. I realize we won't be subsidized housing in 99 years (which is how long the Government promised to lease this land, (which is now more like 91 years; which the builders are trying to renegotiate by the way!)Know that while I'm alive to fight the good fight, God willing, that's what I'll do. If this is politics, count me in!</p>
        <p>I hope you'll be pleased to not only support me as your President of 1760 Bush Street Tenant Association, in the upcoming election, but that you may join in the collective voice when RCA gets approved. I'll be looking for good people to be represented. I'll also have to ask for your formal vote to disassociate with CCSD until there is Oversight. Until there is, we'd be wasting our money giving any to fund the groups' dysfunction.</p>
        <p>We need to save our Democracy now more than ever; a Democracy we wish is fueled by collective voice. I know you might not like the candidates right now, but DEMOCRACY is on the line!</p>
        <p>Having a Dictator will not protect our children... Our S.F. must Stand tall... (While you still can.)</p> <p>Anyone interested in seeing my RCS proposal contact me @ LizzyButterflyz2@gmail.com or @4618.</p> <p>Also anyone interested in joining our TA Board, can come with any affiliate on any 2nd Saturday of the month from 1-3pm in the Community room for Officer trainings! Light refreshments will be served.</p>
        <p>Sincerely Your Loving President,</p>
        <p>of The 1760 Bush Street Tenant Association,</p>
        <p>Margaret M. McNulty</p>
        <p>Fighting The Good Fight!</p>
