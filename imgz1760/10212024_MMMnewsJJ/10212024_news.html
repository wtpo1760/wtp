        <p>Congratulations to Angel for pursuing his hate-mail campaign invasion of privacy through legal texts, and to the disruption of Association time. Because according to Judge Judy, he's permitted to do so. He's allowed to express his opinion however hurtful.</p>
        <p>The Queen Bee dismissed our case, actually both our cases if you include his cross complaint and we were all traumatized by the events which were quite the dog and pony show. A new day's what went on in my previous idol's lair?</p>
        <p>This one in particular, hopes the hate can stop now that it's been heard? I will be focused on building matters and building relations between Management Resident Services and us. Like you've commended me to do, namely:</p>
        <p>#1. Deciding whether we need to get legal representation to have them build our garden back on the ground floor patio.</p>
        <p>Last I reported, we, as the Tenant Association, were trying to replace the area by ourselves; however, the more we got involved in the details, the costlier it was becoming, so we (the Board) thought, "Why should we have to carry the costs to fulfill what Management has always promised, being 'the same or better'!"</p>
        <p>Our patio was torn up, our gardens taken away, removing peaceful enjoyment for many of our elders, and we need to insist they put it back 'the same or better'. I'll keep you posted on the response we get, but if we need to, we'll have to consider getting a lawyer.</p>
        <p>#2. Remember Tenants, the parking out front is for drop off and pick up only. The white curb, by law, permits parking for a 20 minute maximum before you are venerable for tickets and worse: towing. We realize that spaces are limited in the area but we can't inconvenience our handicapped or our fire departments when they need access. Please be considerate or you leave yourself open to the worst repercussions. Especially when parking overnight. You will be cited.</p>
        <p>#3. We are responsible for our guests and any damage they do. Please escort your guests to and from the front door when possible, so they don't run through the building causing havoc.</p>
        <p>#4. Thank you for the great response in attending ART CLASSES. We are well on our way to keeping it regularly. We all want to see it twice a month so keep your attendance up!</p>
        <p>And for those of you who haven't come yet, you are missing great fun. All languages are welcome, Art is the Universal language.</p>
        <p>#5. FOODRUNNERS: With the Holidays coming, we can all feel the hit that has resulted from our Foodrunners program being on hold. If you want to see the program reinstated you must tell Resident Services. If they want us to take back the distribution, we will; we first must let them know you want it. I've heard from many of you who are really asking. Just make sure the powers that be know that you want it back!</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I am exploring the legal recourse we may have to insist they give us access and keep us fed through this most popular and most powerful program.</p>
        <p>Stay tuned for more updates here:</p>
        <p>Always, Your Loving President,</p>
