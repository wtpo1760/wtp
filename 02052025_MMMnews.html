        <p>HAPPY FEBRUARY 2025- IT'S TIME TO THRIVE- IT'S 2025</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>BOY OH BOY, WHEN I SAID I WAS A LITTLE UNDER THE WEATHER, I HAD NO IDEA HOW BAD THE WEATHER WOULD GET- I'M STILL REALLY SICK. I HAVE AN INFECTION ON MY LEG THAT WON'T GO AWAY. TURNS OUT IT'S A SERIOUS RISK TO MY LIFE.OH WELL, NOBODY GETS OUT ALIVE!</p>
        <p>I AM STILL ABLE TO COMPLETE MY DUTIES FOR THE TIME BEING, HAVING A FULL BOARD AND EVERYTHING, BUT IF THE TIME COMES I'LL ASK OUR VICE PRESIDENT, JOHN JOLLY TO STEP IN. LUCKILY THAT HASN'T HAD TO HAPPEN YET.</p>
        <p>OUR MONTHLY BOARD MEETING OF OFFICERS IS HELD @3PM ON EVERY 1ST MONDAY IN THE LIBRARY. FEEL FREE TO BRING YOUR CONCERNS, ALTHOUGH YOU MUST SAVE COMMENT FOR THE END AND BE RECOGNIZED BEFORE CONTRIBUTING. BUT WE WELCOME YOUR CONCERNS. WE CANNOT HELP UNLESS YOU ASK AND WE ARE HERE TO HELP!</p>
        <p>HERE ARE A FEW OF THE THINGS WE'RE WORKING ON:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>WE NEED TO REINSTATE OUR TRIAD MEETINGS ASAP. THEY ARE THE BI-MONTHLY GROUP MEETS, ORDERED BY THE MAYOR'S OFFICE OF HOUSING TO KEEP OPEN COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ALL 3 HEADS OF AUTHORITY HERE-MANAGEMENT, RESIDENT SERVICES, AND YOUR TA.</li>
            <li>HAVING ONE ON ONE AUDIENCE ATTENTION LIKE THAT MAKES IT EASIER TO ADDRESS OUR VITAL ISSUES. FOR EXAMPLE:</li>
            <li>SECURITY. WE ARE ASKING FOR TOTAL COVERAGE. NOT THE ONE PERSON SPORADIC PRESENCE WE HAVE NOW.</li>
            <li>WE LOVE ZACK AND ALL HE'S DONE FOR THE BUILDING BUT WE HAVE TOO MANY GAPS IN SCHEDULING TO SUIT OUR FANCY. WE NEED MORE. IF THAT'S A DESK GUARD WITHOUT ARMOUR OK. WE JUST NEED A FACE AND PLACE WE CAN ACCESS OUR GUARDS 24/7. AFTERALL, IT'S A PREREQUISITE FOR HUD FUNDING TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS-THAT THE BUILDING IS MADE SECURE.</li>
            <li>PARKING IS FINALLY WORKING, FOR THE MOST OF YOU COOPERATING, THAT IS. WE REALIZE IT'S BEEN AN ADJUSTMENT AND WE HAVE BEEN KIND. HOWEVER, IF YOU OR YOUR FRIENDS VIOLATE THE LOADING ZONE RULES, WE'LL HAVE TO CALL FOR TICKETING: BEWARE.</li>
            <li>GROCERY CARTS-WHERE ARE OUR GROCERY CARTS?</li>
            <li>WE WENT TO A LOT OF TROUBLE TO GET PERMISSION TO HAVE THEM ON PREMISES EXPRESSLY FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE BRINGING GROCERIES FROM CURB TO DOOR AND THEY HAVE ALL BUT DISAPPEARED.</li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE HOLDING A GROCERY CART IN YOUR APARTMENT PLEASE RETURN IT TO THE FIRST BAY IN THE GARAGE SO WE CAN ALL USE THE BENEFIT. WHICH ALSO GOES FOR THE LAUNDRY CARTS.</li>
            <li>LAUNDRY CARTS- PLEASE LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY BELONG. IF YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST USE THEM TO QUICKLY TRANSPORT ITEMS OR LAUNDRY TO YOUR ROOM-PLEASE BE CONSIDERATE-RETURN THEM IMMEDIATELY.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>IF YOU'RE REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THAT, AT LEAST PUT THEM IN FRONT OF YOUR DOOR OR INTO THE ELEVATORS SO YOUR KIND NEIGHBORS PASSING BY CAN TAGLEG THEM DOWN TO WHERE THE BELONG.</p>
        <p>NEIGHBORS-IF YOU SEE A LAUNDRY CART IN THE HALLWAY OR ELEVATOR, PLEASE BE SO KIND AS TO BRING IT WITH YOU GOING AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN TO RETURN IT BECAUSE IF IT IS ALONE AND UNATTACHED THAT JUST MEANS SOMEONE IS HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME AND COULD USE YOUR HELP.</p>
        <p>LET'S ALL REMEMBER WE WORK WELL TOGETHER- WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. THIS BUILDING IS MADE UP OF SOME OF THE KINDEST PEOPLE I'VE EVER BEEN PRIVILEGED TO MEET, LET ALONE REPRESENT AND IT'S EASY TO EXTEND LITTLE ACTS OF KINDNESS</p>
        <p>AS WE GO ABOUT OUR DAILY LIVES-AND THE RIPPLES IN THE WATER CONTINUE THAT GOOD, KIND WAVE WE BEGAN AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THE KINDNESSES COME RIGHT BACK TO YOU! THE LOVING ACTS COMPOUND AND WE GROW A LIFE WORTH LIVING- SO LOOK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER- HELP EACH OTHER WHERE YOU CAN.</p>
        <p>WE ARE ALL BLESSED TO HAVE THIS SUBSIDIZED LIVING OPPORTUNITY. SHOW YOU KNOW IT. BE GOOD TO ONE ANOTHER. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR BACK BITING ENEMIES HERE! COMMUNICATION IS KEY. MY ILLNESS IS REMINDING ME LIFE'S TOO SHORT NOT TO CHOOSE LOVE.</p>
        <p>IF YOU ARE HAVING A COMMUNICATION PROBLEM WITH ONE OF YOUR NEIGHBORS, REMEMBER ADVOCACY IS AVAILABLE TO YOU FOR FREE THROUGH MY RCA- RESIDENTS COUNCIL ADVISORY PANEL. I'M HAPPY FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS ALREADY BENEFITTED FROM OUR REPRESENTATION AND I WILL HELP ANYONE WHO ASKS!</p>
        <p>TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES! REMEMBER ANY TENANT WANTING TO TRAIN TO BE A TA OFFICER CAN ATTEND OUR FREE TRAINING SESSIONS HELD IN THE COMMUNITY ROOM EVERY 2ND SATURDAY OF EACH MONTH. THESE TRAININGS ARE HUD APPROVED AND HELD IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL REGULATIONS. ALL AFFILIATE BUILDINGS ARE WELCOME TO ATTEND AS WELL AND WE WILL SOON BE TAKING REFERRALS FROM THE NEW MANAGEMENT @ CCSD.THIS IS EXCITING NEWS!</p>
        <p>CCSD- I'VE ACTUALLY RECEIVED AN APOLOGY FROM CCSD!</p>
        <p>AT THE TIME I STEPPED DOWN, WE ALL LET OUR EMOTIONS COLOR THE SITUATION WHICH WAS BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION. ALL SIDES SEE THAT NOW.</p>
        <p>I HAD BEGGED FOR AN ADVOCATE TO REPRESENT OR EVEN SIMPLE MEDIATION WITH ANYONE OF THEIR CHOOSING AT THE TIME PROBLEMS WERE IN DEVELOPMENT AND THE ONSLAUGHT OF MISINTERPRETATION AS WERE FORTOLD, BUT RCA WASN'T INVENTED YET. CALMER HEADS ARE PREVAILING NOW THOUGH SINCE THEY GOT RID OF THE MAJOR TROUBLEMAKER OVERTHERE AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE NOW HAVE AN OPEN DOOR TO NEGOTIATE A NEW RELATIONSHIP GOING FORWARD WITH THE NEW PRESIDENT (MICHAEL ZORRES FROM 1880 PINE ST) AND HIS NEW ADMINISTRATION! (ALTHOUGH, I STILL THINK THAT THEY ARE WAY OVERPRICED FOR THEIR SERVICES!)WE'LL SEE SOON.</p>
        <p>SOMETIMES MANY FORGET THAT WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME SIDE OF THIS FIGHT WE ARE IN: WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN WE REALIZE: THINK ABOUT IT: WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE HAVE A HOME. WE ALL WANT TO CREATE THE BEST POSSIBLE LIVING CONDITIONS WITHIN THESE HOMES EVEN IF WE ARE ALL IN THE PUBLIC HOUSING COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE PH COMMUNITY, WE WANT TO DO ALL WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR HOUSING RIGHTS, BIG AND SMALL, RIGHT!? OH BOY,OH BOY! MY PASSION IS DEFINATELY BLOOMING!</p>
        <p>I AM SO PROUD THIS HAS BECOME MY CALLING! I DIDN'T KNOW WHY I FOUND MYSELF HOMELESS AT ALL, WHEN IT WAS HAPPENING. NOW I KNOW IT'S MY OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE BACK-ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND GROUP BASIS. (SERIOUSLY REALLY, WHAT'S TO SLING ROCKS AT??) THAT I CARE TO HELP OTHERS??</p>
        <p>(NO WONDER SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY NEVER WANT TO GET INVOLVED). I AM REFERRING HERE TO THE ON-GOING HATE CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED AGAINST ME. WHILE I CAN'T CONTROL WHAT ANYBODY ELSE DOES, OR THE ACTIONS THEY MAY TAKE TO HURT ME I CAN CONTROL MY RESPONSES TO THOSE ACTIONS. I STAY FOCUSED ON DOING GOOD WORK FOR THE COMMUNITY I RESIDE IN AND FOR PEOPLE I'VE COME TO CARE ABOUT (YOU!)- WHICH SPEAKS VOLUMES FOR ITSELF.</p>
        <p>I CHOOSE TO LAZER 'HOCUS POCUS FOCUS' MY WHOLISTIC POSITIVITY INSTEAD AS I REMEMBER, 'HATERS GONNA HATE' SIMPLE AS THAT AND THAT. SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DAMAGED BY LIFE SO MUCH THAT'S ALL THEY KNOW-DAMAGE. THEY CANNOT SPREAD LOVE AND COMPASSION IF THEY ARE NOT LOVE AND COMPASSION THEMSELVES. THEY CAN'T STAND TO SEE HAPPY, FULFILLED GIVERS THRIVING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEE WHAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO BE.</p>
        <p>LOVE WINS, YOURS TRULY, PRESIDENT OF RESIDENTS MMM</p>
