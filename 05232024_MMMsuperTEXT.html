            <p><strong>May 23, '24</p>
            <p>Dear Angel,</p>
            <p>I Really need an answer to 'Why You Are So Obsessed w/ CCSD?'</strong></p>
            <p>All you need to know is they were never worth the money. They did Nothing worth $1,000 a year.</p>
            <p>On top of it, we were charged for elections and nominations $100 each as well-as far back as Beverly Saba. They were supposed to be included. Together, my Board did more of the things CCSD was mandated to do. They just aren't worth it!</p>
            <p>That is why we left. We announced our dissatisfaction to our members all along the way. We pre-announced the vote and the general membership voted UNANIMOUSLY to disaffiliate. If you want to visit joining when your term comes up-go ahead, waste your money.</p>
            <p>The fact that 28 days are between events rather than 30 is not good enough to derail the proceedings. We don't need '5 days to prepare flyers'. We have a template and only the names have to be filled in to be ready to post. Again, we out max ccsd.</p>
            <p>OUR BYLAWS call for an 'INDEPENDENT PARTY'. Read the copy you have.</p>
            <p>The time before last, we had a lawyer from mediation cover. No one objected.</p>
            <p>Ccsd was too busy infighting. Which brings me to the next fact on record: I had no deal with Dennis Katonis, when I became Secretary. He (THEY) voted for ME to be let back in. I wasn't authorized to speak for everyone.</p>
            <p>You see, we left for good reasons. CCSD realized our arguments had validity. For example: a Year ++ of Mary and Dennis? Dennis was in over his head and it showed. NOT ONE BUILDING WOULD COME TO THE GENERAL MEMBERSHIP MEETINGS.</p>
            <p>Buildings (LIKE Rosa Parks) actually THANKED ME FOR STARTING RCA BECAUSE THEIR V.P. attended and left with personal insults. She feared retaliation so she's in the background, not participating AGAIN.</p>
            <p>The truth is The CCSD Secretary, who was never chastised by the way, for her refusal to participate in conflict/ resolution of any kind with me. IS THAT PROFESSIONAL?. What was she so afraid would be revealed? Someone elses side?</p>
            <p>They let her pad the minutes After the facts and look what I was accused of: Writing to HUD and RAD? OMG That was to benefit CCSD. I told Stephanie I would get her examples of the change in utility obligation, so I was RESEARCHING TO REPORT. OH BIG DEMERIT.</p>
            <p>I KNEW it was bad but was Totally Convinced when there were crickets when after an hour of yelling back and forth, I asked to present my Bright Bridge report; proving THEY WOULD RATHER FIGHT THAN HEAR SOLUTIONS TO THEIR PROBLEMS. That did it for me. I was hoping to make a difference. They've had years of ingrained behavior. I couldn't fix it but was willing to try. I would've talked them up at our meetings and seen it through. They just didn't earn it.</p>
            <p>I was accused of 'Interfering in another building's nominations/elections' when I only worked filling candy favors! Stephanie said, "OOPS" and that was that. My BETRAYAL? Was sharing a contract with others that I never even saw. Again, "OOPSIE, MY BAD." She said. And all was forgiven. Who does that? And fires me for it? Talk to the last resigning President! He only lasted a few months, too. IT'S NOT JUST ME!</p>
            <p>Now ccsd is being taken to court because they have forced my hand. They are liable for slander with that invented padding of the facts they've mailed out. Talk about doxing...?</p>
            <p>WE DO NOT HAVE TO BE UNDER CCSD we only have to comport ourselves in like manner.</p>
            <p>In my workings of RCA with SFHA and their annual plan, I have been informed there is plenty of work to go around. Why aren't they happy to have another arm? Talk about power trips! Like only they know the rules!</p>
            <p>Even their heading is a lie: There's more RAD buildings in the City than their measley lot. Thet deceptively act like all RADS are there's. LOOK UP RESIDENT ADVISORY BOARDS. THERE'S MORE FISH IN THE SEA. GOOD RIDDANCE.</p>
            <p>IF THEY WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING WRONG, why would they mind oversight? Think about it: I was asking for oversight over myself along with the group. Their lashing out mailing slanderous remarks, telling the people I'm helping that I am a' psychopath' is not normal reactions. I blessed them and walked away. My work will speak for itself. Come see my copybook. People have asked for advice from me from as far as Santa Clara! I choose civility and agreeing to disagree. They are so insecure they are obsessed with trying to interfere with everything I do!</p>
            <p>I did have a conversation with Michael Zornes.He knew I had to bring our membership on board, so I could never have made a deal by just speaking for everybody- JUST LIKE YOU LECTURE ME I MUST DO. I COULDN'T DECIDE FOR EVERYONE! YOU HAVE THE WRONG OPINION.</p>
            <p>It's like I can't win with you. Damned if I do, damned if I don't. I don't need presents, just your common sense. I appreciated the gesture. I can't keep it.</p>
            <p>This letter from CCSD quotes ccsd bylaws NOT OUR OWN. READ THEM.</p>
            <p>Leesa Barnhart has a team of experienced helpers. CCSD is not the only game in town and they've ruined their chances with us. Maybe if they treated me with a modicum of respect? Which is what I was waiting for as I continually asked for a sit down with any mediator of her choosing.</p>
            <p>I really believed calmer heads would prevail. Boy was I wrong. They just railroaded me out of their little click and the proof is in the pudding. Stopping everything due to 2 days difference with the holiday in between is not rational or IN REALITY justified. 15 DAYS.</p>
            <p>I don't think I've ever doxed in my life. Everything they are sharing is out of context and they're running scared or they wouldn't have to bad mouth me in their process.</p>
            <p style="background-color: yellow; padding: 10px;"><strong>President of any organization is the governing body. They should look it up.</strong> </p>
            <p>They are operating illegally for 6 years! Google it.What more do you have to see? Frankly, I'm surprised. Please answer: Just What is your Obsession with them?</p>
            <p>YOU KNOW, If anybody treated YOU like that, they'd have to get through me to get in the door. We just have different values I guess.</p>
            <p>Love, Margaret McNulty</p>
